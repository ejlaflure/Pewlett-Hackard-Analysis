## Pewlett Hackard Analysis Report
- A large portion of Pewlett Hackard's employees are reaching retirement age over the next few years. This issue can cause a void in the work force if not properly managed. Using the new employee database, the managment team can have a significantly better idea of what employment changes are necessary to prepare for this surge in retirement.
